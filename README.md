# Employee & Department Management System

This system is designed to manage employees and departments efficiently using a clean architectural approach. It adopts a layered structure, separating concerns across **Presentation**, **Business Logic**, and **Data Access Layers** while leveraging Entity Framework Core for persistence.

## üì¶ Project Structure

### 1. **Data Access Layer (DAL)**

> Located in `El-sheikh.MVC.DAL`

- **Entities**:  
  - `Employee.cs`: Represents employee data (Name, Salary, Gender, etc.).
  - `Department.cs`: Defines department structure.
  - `ApplicationUser.cs`: Extends Identity for custom user data.
- **DbContext**:  
  - `ApplicationDbContext.cs`: Manages EF Core interactions.
- **Repositories**:  
  - Generic & specific repositories (EmployeeRepository, DepartmentRepository) for data access logic.
- **Migrations**:  
  - Full EF Core migration history to track schema evolution.

### 2. **Business Logic Layer (BLL)**

> Located in `El-sheikh.MVC.BLL`

- **Services**:  
  - `DepartmentService`, `EmployeeService`: Handle business operations using Unit of Work and Repository patterns.
- **DTOs**:  
  - Transfer models like `EmployeeDto`, `DepartmentDto`, `CreatedEmployeeDto`, etc., used for mapping and validation.

### 3. **Presentation Layer (PL)**

> Located in `El-sheikh.MVC.PL`

- **Controllers**:  
  - `EmployeeController`, `DepartmentController`, `AccountController`: Handle user interaction and delegate tasks to services.
- **ViewModels**:  
  - Used for passing data between views and controllers with validation attributes.
- **Utilities**:  
  - `Email.cs`: Handles system email functionality (e.g., for password reset).
- **AutoMapper**:  
  - `MappingProfile.cs` configures DTO <=> Entity mappings.

## üîÅ Application Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Users sign up/sign in using Identity.
2. **Dashboard Access**: Authorized users manage employees and departments.
3. **Form Submission**: Forms for employee/department creation with validation.
4. **Data Processing**: Handled by BLL via repositories.
5. **Database Update**: EF Core persists changes to the database.
6. **UI Update**: User sees updated employee/department lists or detailed views.

## ‚úÖ Example Use Case

1. Admin logs in.
2. Navigates to the "Employees" section and creates a new employee.
3. Selects a department, uploads an image, and submits.
4. Data is validated, saved, and displayed in the employee list.
